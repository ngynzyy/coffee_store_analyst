## 1. Data Modeling:

## 2. Sales Overview 6months:

**Question:** Mr. Brewer Mark - CFO of Meki Group needs you to provide him with an overview of Meki Group's business situation in the last 6 months.

- By performing transforms and calculations, I have built a dashboard to monitor the business situation through revenue, cost, profit and profit margin indicators of Meki Group in general and each store in particular.

- The snapshot for the console is as follows:

## 3. Customer:
Mr. LeBean Jean - CEO of Meki Group wants to better understand the company's customer base (for example: average age, gender, etc.).

- Regarding the company's customers, I focus on analyzing data on demographics and transaction behavior for the store.

- The snapshot for the console is as follows:

- Insights:
    
    - During the period from 1 - 5am, only a few customers came to transact a large number of products. This is the store's distributor.
    - Customers aged 20-50 and women make up the majority at the store. They tend to come more in the morning.

## 4. Employee Commision:
Help Meki Group calculate the total revenue and average revenue of each employee in Q1 2021 thereby comparing this number with Q1 2022. 

Suppose each employee will be rewarded with 5% commission on revenue, how much commission does each employee receive? The person with the highest commission in each quarter above contributes what % of sales to Meki's entire revenue?

- I have built a quarterly revenue report for 2021 and 2022 for each employee in the company.

- We can easily track the revenue each employee brings along with the % of that person's contribution. The commission table will also be used to calculate 5% of the revenue the employee brings.

- It will look like the following:
